A **Slot** object represents the attachment slot for a bone in a Spine skeleton. It holds color 
tints (RGBA), a current attachment, and a reference to its owning bone. 
Each slot can be manipulated independently to change visuals (e.g., attachments)
or adjust colors.

Below is a list of the Slotâ€™s properties. Most can be **read or written**, except for the slot
name and bone reference.
