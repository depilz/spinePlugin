Overview
........
--------

A **Bone** object represents one bone in the Spine skeletonâ€™s transform hierarchy. Each
bone has position, rotation, scale, and shear values, as well as references to a parent bone
and matrix components that affect how child bones and attachments are transformed.

Below are all the properties exposed by a Bone. Most can be **read and/or written**. Some
properties (like ``name`` or ``parent``) are read-only.
