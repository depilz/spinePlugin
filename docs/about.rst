About
===================================

Hello! My name is **Denis Pilz**, and I’m a game developer with over eight
years of experience using **Solar2D**. I currently work for **Studycat
Limited**, which provided support as I developed this Spine plugin—while
I also invested my own free time.


Motivation
----------
----------

I’ve always appreciated how **Spine** can bring 2D characters to life
with smooth skeletal animations. However, older Lua implementations and
rendering setups presented limitations—particularly for the newest
**physics features** in Spine 4.2. Determined to overcome these
bottlenecks, I set out to build a more **efficient Spine Runtime** that
would harness Solar2D’s capabilities.

Result
------
------

I’m pleased to say these past hurdles are now a thing of the past!
Whether you need sophisticated physics for bones or just want to animate
seamlessly without performance slowdowns, this plugin aims to help. 
I’m excited to share it with the wider Solar2D and Spine communities, 
hoping it encourages more developers to discover **how well these
two powerful tools can fit together**.

Background
----------
----------

- **Role**: Game Developer (Studycat Limited)
- **Solar2D Experience**: 8+ years
- **Spine Background**: Longtime user, thoroughly familiar with its
  animation workflows and advanced features.

Acknowledgments
---------------
---------------

- **Studycat Limited**: For supporting me in bringing this project to
  life while I was working at the company.
- **Solar2D Community**: For consistently driving me to improve
  performance and share my findings.
- **Spine**: For continually innovating 2D skeletal animation,
  including the latest physics features that motivated me to
  tackle this project.

I truly hope this plugin serves you well for building smooth, performant,
and fully featured 2D games or applications—whether you’re a seasoned
Spine animator or brand-new to Solar2D. Enjoy animating!
